1. OVERVIEW AND SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE
=======================================

The Simplified Image Converter is a clean, user-friendly full-stack web application built with Next.js that allows users to convert multiple images between different formats (JPG, PNG, WebP). Here's how the simplified version works:

Frontend (Client-side):
- React component with multiple file upload support
- Single drag-and-drop interface for multiple files
- Batch processing with real-time progress tracking
- Conditional download options based on number of images
- ZIP file creation and download functionality
- Clean UI matching homepage color scheme

Backend (Server-side):
- Next.js API route optimized for batch processing
- Sharp library for high-performance image processing
- Enhanced error handling for multiple file operations
- Optimized image output with quality settings

Simplified Data Flow:
1. User uploads multiple images via the single upload area
2. Frontend validates each file type and size individually
3. Images are sent to the API endpoint in controlled batches (3 at a time)
4. Backend processes each image using Sharp with progress tracking
5. Converted images are collected and managed in frontend state
6. User gets conditional download options:
   - < 5 images: Individual downloads + ZIP option
   - â‰¥ 5 images: ZIP download only
7. ZIP files are created client-side using JSZip library

2. MULTIPLE FILE UPLOAD IMPLEMENTATION
=====================================

Simplified Upload Method:
1. Single File Input: File input with multiple attribute for multiple file selection
2. Drag and Drop: Enhanced to handle multiple files with visual feedback

Key Technical Concepts:

FileList to Array Conversion:
```javascript
const fileArray = Array.from(files)
```
- FileList objects are array-like but not true arrays
- Array.from() creates a proper array for easier manipulation
- Enables use of array methods like forEach, map, filter

Simplified Upload Implementation:
```html
<input type="file" multiple accept="image/*" />
```
- Multiple attribute enables multiple file selection
- Simple click-to-browse functionality
- Drag and drop support for multiple files

Validation for Multiple Files:
- Individual file type checking for each uploaded file
- Size validation per file (10MB limit each)
- Total file count validation (100 files maximum)
- Separate tracking of valid, invalid, and oversized files

3. BATCH PROCESSING AND CONVERSION LOGIC
=======================================

Batch Processing Strategy:
- Process 3 images simultaneously to balance speed and server load
- Use Promise.all() for parallel processing within each batch
- Sequential batch processing to prevent server overload
- Real-time progress tracking for user feedback

Technical Implementation:

Batch Size Optimization:
```javascript
const batchSize = 3 // Process 3 images at a time
for (let i = 0; i < selectedFiles.length; i += batchSize) {
  const batch = selectedFiles.slice(i, i + batchSize)
  // Process batch...
}
```

Progress Calculation:
```javascript
const progressPercent = Math.min((completedCount / selectedFiles.length) * 100, 100)
```

Error Handling in Batches:
- Individual error tracking per image
- Continuation of processing even if some images fail
- Separate arrays for successful and failed conversions
- Detailed error reporting for failed conversions

4. ZIP FILE CREATION AND MANAGEMENT
===================================

ZIP File Implementation using JSZip:

Why JSZip?
- Client-side ZIP creation (no server storage needed)
- Supports various file formats and blob data
- Memory efficient streaming for large files
- Cross-browser compatibility

ZIP Creation Process:
1. Create new JSZip instance
2. Create organized folder structure inside ZIP
3. Add each converted image blob to the ZIP
4. Generate ZIP file as blob
5. Create download URL and trigger download
6. Clean up URLs to prevent memory leaks

Technical Implementation:
```javascript
const zip = new JSZip()
const imagesFolder = zip.folder("converted_images")

// Add files to folder
for (const convertedImage of convertedImages) {
  const fileName = `${originalName}_converted.${targetFormat}`
  imagesFolder.file(fileName, convertedImage.convertedBlob)
}

// Generate and download
const zipBlob = await zip.generateAsync({type: "blob"})
```

File Organization:
- All converted images placed in "converted_images" folder
- Consistent naming: originalname_converted.format
- Maintains original filename structure
- ZIP filename includes format: converted_images_webp.zip

5. CONDITIONAL DOWNLOAD LOGIC
============================

Smart Download Options Based on File Count:

Less than 5 images:
- Individual download buttons for each converted image
- Additional ZIP download option for convenience
- User can choose download method preference

5 or more images:
- Only ZIP download option shown
- Reduces UI clutter for large batches
- Encourages efficient bulk downloading

Implementation Logic:
```javascript
{convertedImages.length < 5 ? (
  // Show both individual and ZIP options
) : (
  // Show only ZIP option
)}
```

Benefits:
- Improved user experience for different use cases
- Reduced server load for large batches
- Organized file management for users
- Prevents browser download manager overflow

6. FRONTEND COMPONENT STRUCTURE (SIMPLIFIED)
===========================================

Simplified State Management:
- selectedFiles: Array of File objects for multiple file handling
- convertedImages: Array of conversion results with metadata
- conversionProgress: Percentage for batch progress tracking

```javascript
const [selectedFiles, setSelectedFiles] = useState([])
const [convertedImages, setConvertedImages] = useState([])
const [conversionProgress, setConversionProgress] = useState(0)
```

- Streamlined drag and drop processing
- Batch conversion coordination
- Progress updates during processing
